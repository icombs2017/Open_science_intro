Using Rmarkdown, GitHub, and Zenodo for reproducible and acessible code and data
***

A basic introduction to working in *Rmarkdown* and using *GitHub* to keep data and code organized and version controlled.
I also touch on using *Zenodo* to archive repositories and create a Digital Object Identifier.
This is a jumping off point for those interested in using these reasources for good data practices for open science. This is by **no means** exhaustive.
Use this as an introduction and basic starting point to get familiar with these techniques. Both *Rmarkdown* and *GitHub* are very powerful and you will learn new and interesting ways to incorporate them into your everyday workflow (I hope!).
